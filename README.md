# 🐍 Snake Game Project

Welcome to the Snake Game Project! This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). Throughout this project, several web development skills were learned and applied. This README provides an overview of the project and highlights the key skills developed during its creation.

# 🎮 Project Overview

The Snake Game is a web-based application where players control a snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or itself. The game includes the following features:

Start Game Button: Prevents the game from starting automatically and allows the player to start when ready.
Try Again Button: Appears after the game ends, allowing the player to restart the game.
Previous Scores Table: Displays a list of previous scores, encouraging players to beat their high scores.
Responsive Design: The game canvas and elements are positioned for optimal viewing.
Keyboard Controls: Players use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.

# 🛠️ Skills Learned

1. HTML5 & Semantic Markup 📄
- Structuring Content: Learned to use HTML elements like div, canvas, button, and table to structure the webpage logically.
- Canvas Element: Utilized the canvas element for rendering the game graphics.
- Semantic Elements: Applied semantic HTML to improve accessibility and readability.
2. CSS3 Styling 🎨
- Styling Components: Styled buttons, score displays, and the game canvas for a cohesive look.
- Positioning Elements: Used CSS positioning to align elements like the canvas and score table.
- Responsive Design: Ensured that the game displays correctly on different screen sizes.
3. JavaScript Programming 💻
- Game Logic Development: Implemented the game mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
- Event Handling: Managed keyboard inputs for controlling the snake and button clicks for starting or restarting the game.
- Canvas Manipulation: Drew the snake, food, and other game elements on the canvas.
- DOM Manipulation: Updated the score display and dynamically created HTML elements like the "Try Again" button.
- Functions and Scope: Organized code into functions with proper scope to maintain readability and reusability.
- Arrays and Data Structures: Used arrays to track the snake's body parts and previous scores.
- Timers and Game Loop: Utilized setTimeout to create a game loop that updates the game state at regular intervals.
4. Python & Flask Backend 🐍
- Setting Up a Web Server: Created a simple Flask application to serve the HTML file, allowing the game to run on a local server.
- Routing: Defined routes to handle HTTP requests and serve static files.
- Integration with Frontend: Connected the frontend game with the backend server seamlessly.
5. Problem-Solving & Debugging 🐞
- Error Handling: Identified and fixed bugs related to game mechanics and user interactions.
- Logical Thinking: Applied logical reasoning to implement game rules and prevent invalid actions (e.g., snake reversing direction).
- Testing: Tested the game thoroughly to ensure all features work as intended.
6. User Experience (UX) Design 🎯
- Interactive Elements: Added interactive buttons and feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience.
- Visual Feedback: Updated the score in real-time and provided visual cues for game over and restarting.
- Accessibility: Considered keyboard accessibility for game controls.
